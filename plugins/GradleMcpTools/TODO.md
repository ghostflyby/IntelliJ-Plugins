# GradleMcpTools TODO

Status: In Progress
Last Updated: 2026-02-28

## Active Plan

1. Add regression tests that lock DTO and schema compatibility for existing MCP tool result shapes.
2. Add targeted tests for timeout and cancellation result semantics in task execution and project sync flows.
3. Review whether sync should also adopt a visible background progress mode or stay activity-only.
